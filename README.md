# refactor-for-accessibility
First bootcamp challenge, refactoring code to be more accessible for people who need assistance. This is done by changing non-semantic elements to semantic elements, making sure the elements follow a logical structure, ensuring icons and images have proper "alt" attributes, headings go in proper order, and the "title" element is short, but descriptive.

Here is a screenshot of the finished project.
